TASK 16 – WALMART SALES FORECASTING REPORT

Dataset Used:
Walmart Sales Forecasting Dataset (Kaggle Competition Dataset)
Total Records: 421,570
Columns: Store, Dept, Date, Weekly_Sales, IsHoliday

Objective:
To forecast future weekly sales using time-series forecasting techniques
for business planning and demand management.

Process Followed:

1. Data Preprocessing:
   - Converted Date column into datetime format.
   - Sorted dataset by Date.
   - Aggregated total Weekly_Sales by Date (company-level sales).

2. Exploratory Analysis:
   - Plotted weekly sales trend over time.
   - Observed yearly seasonal patterns.
   - Used rolling mean to smooth short-term fluctuations.

3. Train-Test Split:
   - Split data into 80% training and 20% testing.
   - Time-based split used to preserve chronological order.

4. Model Applied:
   - Exponential Smoothing (Additive Trend + Additive Seasonality).
   - Seasonal period set to 52 (weekly data → 52 weeks per year).

5. Forecasting:
   - Predicted future weekly sales for test period.
   - Compared predicted values with actual sales.

6. Model Evaluation:
   - MAE (Mean Absolute Error):1824922.987780064
   - MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error): 3.9407741270743815 %

Results Interpretation:
The model successfully captured the overall sales trend and yearly
seasonality pattern. Forecast accuracy depends on external factors
such as holidays, economic changes, and sudden market fluctuations.

Business Insight:
Time-series forecasting helps in:
- Inventory planning
- Revenue prediction
- Staffing optimization
- Supply chain management

Conclusion:
Exponential Smoothing is effective for capturing trend and seasonality
in retail sales data. For higher accuracy, advanced models like ARIMA
or machine learning-based forecasting can be explored.

Final Outcome:
Successfully implemented time-series forecasting and evaluated model
performance using business-relevant metrics (MAE and MAPE).
